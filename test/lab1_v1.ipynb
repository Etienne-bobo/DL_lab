    "* the mean loss over the epoch: it should be decreasing!\n",
    "* the accuracy on the dev set: it should be increasing!\n",
    "* the accuracy on the train set: it shoud be increasing!\n",

    "If you observe a decreasing loss (+increasing accuracy on test data) but decreasing accuracy on dev data, your network is overfitting!\n",

    "Once you have build **and tested** this a simple training loop, you should introduce the following improvements:\n",
    "* instead of evaluating on dev after each loop on the training data, you can also evaluate on dev n times per epoch\n",
    "* shuffle the data before each epoch\n",
    "* instead of memorizing the parameters of the last epoch only, you should have a copy of the parameters that produced the best value on dev data during training and evaluate on test with those instead of the parameters after the last epoch\n",
    "* learning rate decay: if you do not observe improvement on dev, you can try to reduce the step size\n",
    "\n",
    "After you conducted (successful?) experiments, you should write a report with results."
